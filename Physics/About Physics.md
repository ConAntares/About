# About Physics

这是一块有关物理的自留地, 我也许会用中文写作, 也或者用英文写作, 因为这只是我收集或者抒发自己感想的地方.  
This is a field about Physics. Maybe I will write in Chinese, perhaps in English, because this field is used to collect and express thoughts.

## Physics

物理学是研究物质, 能量, 和它们的相互作用的学科.  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; - 第23界国际纯粹物理与应用物理脸和会议决议, 1999, @ 亚特兰大.

It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong!  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; - Richard Feynman.

物理学代表着一套获得知识, 组织知识和运用知识的有效步骤和方法. 把这套方法运用到什么问题上, 这问题就变成了物理学.  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; - 赵凯华.

很多学生在学习中形成一种印象, 以为物理学就是一些验算. 演算是物理学的一部分, 但不是最重要的部分. 物理学最重要的部分是和现象有关的. 绝大部分物理学是从现象中来的. 现象是物理学的根源.  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; - 杨振宁.

The world has persisted many a long year, having once been set going in the appropriate motions. From these everything else follows.  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; - C. Lucretius, 50 BC.

## Relativity

To Einstein, it was very obvious that nature would not design a system, in which mechanical laws are the same, but laws of electricity are different.  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; - Ramamurti Shankar @ YALE.

We have faith that the underlying laws of nature will have a certain elegance and a certain beauty, and a certain uniformity across all of natural phenomena. That is a faith that we have. It is not a religious issue.  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; - Ramamurti Shankar @ YALE.

如果一个事件从一个参考系观测可以发生, 从另一个参考系观测必然也可以发生. 事件的发生与否与参考系的选取无关.  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; - box 君 @ PKU.

## Mathematical Physics

It is said that mathematics is the language of Nature. If so, then physics is its poetry.  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; - Sadri Hassani.

数学是一门赋予不同事物相同名称的艺术.  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; - 庞加莱.
