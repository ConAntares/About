# About Physics

这是一块有关物理的自留地, 我也许会用中文写作, 也或者用英文写作, 因为这只是我收集或者抒发自己感想的地方.  
This is a field about Physics. Maybe I will write in Chinese, perhaps in English, because this field is used to collect and express thoughts.

## Relativity

如果一个事件从一个参考系观测可以发生, 从另一个参考系观测必然也可以发生. 事件的发生与否与参考系的选取无关.

## Mathematical Physics

如果说数学是大自然的语言, 那么物理就是大自然的诗歌.  
It is said that mathematics is the language of Nature. If so, then physics
is its poetry.
