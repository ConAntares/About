# About Physics

这是一块有关物理的自留地, 我也许会用中文写作, 也或者用英文写作, 因为这只是我收集或者抒发自己感想的地方.  
This is a field about Physics. Maybe I will write in Chinese, perhaps in English, because this field is used to collect and express thoughts.

## Relativity

To Einstein, it was very obvious that nature would not design a system, in which mechanical laws are the same, but laws of electricity are different.

We have faith that the underlying laws of nature will have a certain elegance and a certain beauty, and a certain uniformity across all of natural phenomena. That is a faith that we have. It is not a religious issue.

如果一个事件从一个参考系观测可以发生, 从另一个参考系观测必然也可以发生. 事件的发生与否与参考系的选取无关.

## Mathematical Physics

It is said that mathematics is the language of Nature. If so, then physics
is its poetry.
